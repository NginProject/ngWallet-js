= How to find all smart contracts with particular code

Imagine you've just found critical vulnerability in popular smart contract.
A bug allows you to withdraw all coins from contract. You did it with your friend's contract
but you know that there are a plenty of such contracts on the blockchain, a huge bunch of money, right?

How to find them all? Let's try.

Smart contract in Ethereum is just account which holds compiled code.
So the simplest solution is to check all accounts and build a map `address` to `code`.

We will use `ngin_getCode` JSON-RPC method to retrieve code for particular address.

== Local full node

Install you own full node. Without local instance you are on the risk to be banned by remote end point.

Got to http://github.com/ethereumproject/go-ethereum and get latest version.


== Requirements

This tutorial uses Typescript. Let's prepare environment.

You need:

* nodejs and npm
* typescript - `sudo npm install -g typescript`
* ts-node - `sudo npm install -g ts-node`

== Step 1

Create simple npm project

`mkdir all-contracts`

`cd all-contracts`

`npm init`

Leave all parameters as it suggests.

Create `index.ts` file.

```
console.log('Hello ETC');
```

Run it

`ts-node index.ts`

Ok, it works, you are able to run Typescript programs now.


Install `emerald-js` package:

`npm install -S https://github.com/ETCDEVTeam/emerald-js.git#ethrpc-api-web3`


Create RPC client:

[source,javascript]
----
const rpc = new EthRpc(new JsonRpc(new HttpTransport("http://localhost:8545")));
----

Because emerald-js API methods return promises in most cases we will be using `async/await` pair.

Lets write our `run()` method which obtains number of last known block:

[source,javascript]
----
async function run() {
    const lastBlockNumber = await rpc.eth.getBlockNumber();

    console.log(lastBlockNumber);
}

run();

----


We will be using Immutable JS, let's install it:

`npm install -S immutable`

Install typings for node js:

`npm install -S @types/node`



full index.ts
[source,javascript]
----
import { EthRpc, JsonRpc, HttpTransport } from 'emerald-js';
import { Map } from 'immutable';

const rpc = new EthRpc(new JsonRpc(new HttpTransport("https://web3.gastracker.io")));

let contracts = Map<string, string>();

async function run() {
    const lastBlockNumber = await rpc.eth.getBlockNumber();

    process.stdout.write(`last block: ${lastBlockNumber}\n`);

    // Process every block from genesis
    for (let i = 0; i <= lastBlockNumber; i++) {
        process.stdout.write(`processing: ${i} block, found ${contracts.size} addresses\r`);
        const block = await rpc.eth.getBlock(i, true);
        if (block.transactions.length === 0) {
            continue;
        }

        // process every Tx in block
        for (let j = 0; j < block.transactions.length; j++) {
            const tx = block.transactions[j];
            // check whether we have seen from and to addresses
            if (contracts.get(tx.from, null) === null) {
                // try to get contract code
                const code = await rpc.eth.getCode(tx.from);
                contracts = contracts.set(tx.from, code);
            }

            if (tx.to && contracts.get(tx.from, null) === null) {
                // try to get contract code
                const code = await rpc.eth.getCode(tx.to);
                contracts = contracts.set(tx.to, code);
            }
        }
    }
    console.log(contracts.toJS());
}

run();

----

Now we have all smart contracts with thier code. We can use text search
to find particular contract by code. 
Applying some imagination it is easy to add code which filters contracts by code value.


PS. There is another approche to find smart contracts.
As we know if tx creates contract it has `to` field equal to `null` and reciept contains `contractAddress` field.
